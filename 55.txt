- NEXT STEP: Proceed to Phase 15: Monetization.
================================================================================
================================================================================
- DATE: 2025-12-24
- ACTION: Fixed OpenGraph Metadata Error and Improved Slug Generation.
- DETAILS:
  - **Metadata Fix:** Resolved "Invalid OpenGraph type: product" runtime error by changing the OpenGraph type from `product` to `website` in `frontend/src/lib/seo.ts`. While `product` is a valid OG type, Next.js metadata validation in newer versions is more restrictive.
  - **Shared Utilities:** Created `shared/src/utils/slug.ts` to centralize slug generation logic for both frontend and backend.
  - **Form Automation:** Updated `DeviceForm.tsx` to automatically generate URL-friendly slugs from device names using the new shared utility. This prevents issues like slugs containing spaces (e.g., "RedMagic 11 Pro" becoming "redmagic-11-pro").
  - **Backend Consistency:** Refactored `backend/src/common/utils/slug.util.ts` to use the shared implementation, ensuring consistent URL structures project-wide.
- RESULT: Device detail pages now load correctly without runtime errors, and new devices will automatically have SEO-friendly URLs.

- ACTION: Fixed Category Visibility, Deletion, and Update Validation.
- DETAILS:
  - **Data Visibility:** Added `@Expose()` to `CategoryResponseDto` and `DeviceResponseDto` fields. This fixes the issue where categories were "invisible" because their properties were being stripped during JSON serialization by the NestJS interceptor.
  - **Validation Fix:** Updated `CategoryForm` and `DeviceForm` to only send allowed fields to the API. This resolves the `BadRequestException` ("property id should not exist") caused by sending internal Mongoose/Class-Transformer properties back to the server.
  - **Deletion Logic:** corrected `apiClient.getCategoryById` to use the proper `id` field and updated backend to use `findByIdAndDelete` for better compatibility with string IDs.
  - **Conflict Prevention:** Added server-side checks for duplicate names/slugs in `CategoriesService` and `DevicesService`.
- RESULT: Categories and Devices are now correctly visible, editable, and deletable. 
- NEXT STEP: Complete remaining Admin sub-tasks or proceed to Phase 15: Monetization.

    - Added bcrypt for secure password hashing.
    - Updated `AppModule` to include new auth and users modules.
    - Enhanced `seed.ts` to automatically create a default admin user (`admin@gsmhub.com` / `admin123`).
  - **Frontend Admin Panel:**
    - Implemented `AuthContext` for client-side authentication state management (JWT storage in localStorage).
    - Created `AdminLayout` with a persistent sidebar, authentication guards (redirect to login), and dynamic headers.
    - Developed `AdminLoginPage` with credential validation and error handling.
    - Created `AdminDashboard` with placeholder statistics.
    - Created `AdminDevicesPage` featuring a searchable table for device management and deletion capability.

- ACTION: Fixed Device ID Serialization Issue.
- DETAILS:
  - Addressed a console error "Encountered two children with the same key, `[object Object]`" on the frontend.
  - Identified that the backend `DeviceResponseDto` was not explicitly exposing `_id` as a string, causing Mongoose ObjectId objects to leak into the JSON response (as POJOs via `.lean()`), which React coerced to the generic string "[object Object]".
  - Updated `backend/src/modules/devices/dto/device-response.dto.ts` to explicitly transform and expose `_id` as a string.
- RESULT: Device IDs are now correctly serialized as strings, resolving the unique key error in React lists.

================================================================================

IMPLEMENTATION LOG
================================================================================
- DATE: 2025-12-03
- ACTION: Troubleshoot and fix backend startup issues.
- DETAILS:
  - The backend was failing to start due to a "Cannot find module 'dist/main'" error. This was caused by an incorrect build configuration that produced a nested output directory because of shared modules.
  - The `tsconfig.json` was configured to use `rootDirs` to handle the shared module.
  - The `start:prod` script in `package.json` was updated to point to the correct nested entry file (`dist/backend/src/main`).
  - The `build` script was changed to use `tsc` directly instead of `nest build`.
  - The `start:dev` script was changed to use `ts-node-dev` with `tsconfig-paths/register` to correctly handle path aliases during development.
- RESULT: The backend application now starts successfully in both development and production mode.
- NEXT STEP: Continue with the implementation of the Devices module as per the roadmap.
================================================================================
- DATE: 2025-12-04
- ACTION: Troubleshoot and fix frontend compilation errors.
- DETAILS:
  - Resolved "Type error: Property 'name' does not exist on type 'Device'" by adding `name: string;` to the `Device` interface in `shared/src/types/index.ts`.
  - Resolved "Type error: Property '_id' does not exist on type 'Device'" by renaming `id?: string;` to `_id?: string;` in the `Device` interface in `shared/src/types/index.ts` to align with MongoDB's `_id`.
  - Resolved "Type error: Type 'DeviceSpec' is not assignable to type '{ [key: string]: string; }'" in `SpecsTable.tsx` by refactoring the specification grouping logic to correctly group `DeviceSpec[]` into `{[category: string]: {[key: string]: string}}`.
- RESULT: The frontend application now builds successfully and runs without the previously reported compilation errors.
- NEXT STEP: Continue with the implementation of the Devices module as per the roadmap.
================================================================================
- DATE: 2025-12-05
- ACTION: User verification of frontend compilation error fixes.
- DETAILS:
  - User successfully ran the frontend application.
  - Device detail pages loaded correctly, displaying device name, specifications, and other details without visible errors.
- RESULT: Frontend Hughes confirmed and verified by the user.
- NEXT STEP: Continue with the implementation of the Devices module as per the roadmap.
================================================================================
- DATE: 2025-12-06
- ACTION: Implement and debug search functionality.
- DETAILS:
  - **Issue 1: Frontend `params` promise error:** The `DevicePage` component in `frontend/src/app/devices/[slug]/page.tsx` was incorrectly handling the `params` object, leading to a "params is a Promise" error.
    - **Fix:** Reverted the `DevicePage` to use `params: promiseParams` and `const params = await promiseParams;` to correctly resolve the promise before accessing `params.slug`.
  - **Issue 2: Backend "Internal Server Error" (500) due to `class-transformer` circular dependency:** The NestJS backend was throwing a `RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded` when serializing `Device` objects with nested `Category` objects. This was because `DeviceResponseDto` directly referenced the Mongoose `Category` schema, creating a circular dependency during transformation.
    - **Fix 1 (Debugging):** Added `console.error` to `backend/src/common/filters/http-exception.filter.ts` to reveal the full stack trace.
    - **Fix 2 (Circular Dependency):** Created `backend/src/modules/categories/dto/category-response.dto.ts` and updated `backend/src/modules/devices/dto/device-response.dto.ts` to use this new DTO for the `category` property, breaking the circular reference.
  - **Issue 3: Backend "Cannot find module" error:** After fixing the circular dependency, a module resolution error occurred in the backend due to an incorrect relative import path.
    - **Fix:** Corrected the import path in `backend/src/modules/devices/dto/device-response.dto.ts` from `../categories/dto/category-response.dto` to `../../categories/dto/category-response.dto`.
  - **Issue 4: Frontend `device.specs.forEach is not a function` error:** The `SpecsTable` component expected `device.specs` to be an array, but the backend was returning it as an object due to existing data in the database, which was defined as `type: Object` in the Mongoose schema. The schema change to `type: [DeviceSpecSchema]` did not automatically migrate existing data.
    - **Fix 1 (Backend Schema):** Modified `backend/src/modules/devices/device.schema.ts` to define `specs` as an array of `DeviceSpec` objects.
    - **Fix 2 (Backend Data Fetching):** Added `.lean()` to the `findBySlug` method in `backend/src/modules/devices/devices.repository.ts` to ensure plain JavaScript objects are returned, preventing `class-transformer` issues with Mongoose documents.
    - **Fix 3 (Frontend Robustness):** Implemented a transformation logic in `frontend/src/components/devices/SpecsTable.tsx` to convert `device.specs` from an object to an array if it's not already an array, assigning a default 'General' category. This handles legacy data gracefully.
- RESULT: The search functionality now works end-to-end. Clicking a search result correctly navigates to the device page, which loads and displays all device details, including specifications, without errors.
- NEXT STEP: Continue with 10.2 Tailwind CSS Setup.
